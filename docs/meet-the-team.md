    <h3 class="name">Rodrigo Vallejos</h3>
    <p class="bio">I am a MSc. student in the Genome Science and Technology program in the Huntsman Lab at BC Cancer. My research focuses on mapping the oncogenic journey of a seemingly normal Fallopian tube cell towards low grade serous ovarian carcinoma, and how different gynecological stromas act as guides for that journey. Outside of the lab, I enjoy watching documentaries on just about anything and trying to find live performances around the city.</p>

    <p class="bio">Hi folks! My name is Marie Iâ€™m currently an PhD candidate in the Medical Genetics program. I grew up in Fairfield, CT, USA, and moved to Vancouver in 2014 for my undergrad degree at UBC. My thesis project involves creating and validating a neural organoid model of Substance Use Disorder, but Iâ€™m also involved in various Alzheimerâ€™s Disease studies. Outside of the lab, you can find me hiking, camping, cycling, or playing competitive quidditch. Ask me about video games, fantasy novels, local craft beers, or my adorable foster rescue rabbits!</p>
